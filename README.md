# Spartan3SK-Audio

12-bit ADC and DAC to develop audio projects on a
Spartan 3E Starter Kit development board.

Audio is working on 1 channel but modules are easily modifiable to
get stereo sound.

Read the datasheet to get it working since it needs a reference voltage
of 1.65V to acquire analog data and Gain needed is also easily modifible.

Works with on-board 50MHz clock with a default sample rate of ~40kHz.
